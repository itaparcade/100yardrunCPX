# 100yardrunCPX
100 Yard Run is a NeoPixel based Football Game for the Circuit Playground Express (CPX) board coded with CircuitPython.  It was inspired by the classic handheld Mattel football Light Emitting Diode (LED) game first released by Mattel around 1977.  I created 100 Yard Run to show student coders how you can create fun games with just NeoPixels and CircuitPython.  The original Mattel football game has a grid of 3 x 9 LEDs where you can move your LED player up and down as well as left and right to avoid the opposing players.  With just 10 NeoPixels available on the CPX I had to be a little creative mapping a football to the CPX.  Please visit our blog to get more information about this project as well as other NeoPixel games we are creating to inspire students to code.
